## RED Node Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to create a table of sortable data by building out all of the server side functionality and making the necessary connections between the server and the client. See the [README](server/README.md) for the complete list of server "to dos". 


The majority of the UI has been completed except for connecting the client side API. See the [README](client/README.md) for the complete list of client "to dos".
